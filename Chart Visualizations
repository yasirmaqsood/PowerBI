7. Etc .........

 --> Bar and column charts are best used to compare specific values across different categories.
 --> Scatter charts combine two values, the x-axis and y-axis, into a single data point. They are best used to highlight intersections in data. 
     Types include: scatter, bubble, and dot plot chart. 
 --> Waterfall charts are best used to show how a value is affected by positive and negative changes and they show a progression from the initial value. 
 --> Funnel charts are sequenced charts best used to show how data flows between stages. 
 --> Ribbon charts are best used to show highest to lowest values or rank.
 
 
 ----------------------------------------------- SCATTER PLOT ------------------------------------------------
 
Scatter charts show the relationship between two numerical values, making it easier to identify correlational relationships.
Click and drag the data field you want to group the values by to the values field.
  This field must be unique for each point you want to plot. To avoid having one data point that aggregates the values on the X and Y axes.
  Click and drag the data fields that should be displayed in the legend to the legend field.
Click and drag the data fields you want to use in the X axis and Y axis fields.
To visually emphasize a specific value with bubble sizes, click and drag the data field you want to emphasize to the size field.
If a scatter chart contains a lot of information, it may be helpful to add "Reference Line" or "Benchmarks" to get a complete picture of yoour data.
  >> You can Click Visualizations->Analytics->Further Analytics (3rd Option) to add further analytics
  You can add Max, Min, Average, X-Constant, Y-Constant reference Line and Data Labels and change their colors and values from Further Analytics.
  
  
   ----------------------------------------------- WATERFALL CHART ------------------------------------------------
   
Waterfall charts show a running total to help understand how an initial value is affected by a series of positive and negative changes. 
Click and drag the field you want to display on the x-axis of the waterfall chart to the category field.
Click and drag the value you want to display to the y-axis field.
To change the sort order or the field the waterfall chart is sorted by click the "More options" icon on the waterfall chart 3 Dots.
To add additional data to the visualization, click and drag the data field to the "Breakdown Field".


   ----------------------------------------------- FUNNEL CHART ----------------------------------------------------
   
   Funnel charts are useful for displaying data that has sequential changes.
   With the new funnel chart, we can easily identify at which stage in the process the values drastically decrease/increase in our data.
   
   
   ----------------------------------------------- RIBBON CHART ----------------------------------------------------
   
   Ribbon charts are a great choice to easily identify the highest value in your data set for each time period. 
   Click and drag the data field for the time period to the axis field.
   Click and drag the data field for the category to use to the legend field
   Click and drag the data field for the value to display in the ribbon chart to the values field.
   The ribbon chart populates with the selected data with the highest value always displayed at the top. Identify rank changes over a period of time with ribbon charts.
