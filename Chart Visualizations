 --> Bar and column charts are best used to compare specific values across different categories.
 --> Scatter charts combine two values, the x-axis and y-axis, into a single data point. They are best used to highlight intersections in data. 
     Types include: scatter, bubble, and dot plot chart. 
 --> Waterfall charts are best used to show how a value is affected by positive and negative changes and they show a progression from the initial value. 
 --> Funnel charts are sequenced charts best used to show how data flows between stages. 
 --> Ribbon charts are best used to show highest to lowest values or rank.
 
 
 ----------------------------------------------- SCATTER PLOT ------------------------------------------------
 
Scatter charts show the relationship between two numerical values, making it easier to identify correlational relationships.
Click and drag the data field you want to group the values by to the values field.
  This field must be unique for each point you want to plot. To avoid having one data point that aggregates the values on the X and Y axes.
  Click and drag the data fields that should be displayed in the legend to the legend field.
Click and drag the data fields you want to use in the X axis and Y axis fields.
To visually emphasize a specific value with bubble sizes, click and drag the data field you want to emphasize to the size field.
If a scatter chart contains a lot of information, it may be helpful to add "Reference Line" or "Benchmarks" to get a complete picture of yoour data.
